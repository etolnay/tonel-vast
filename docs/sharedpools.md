# Shared pools

## Introduction

VAST's way of declaring and/or initializing Shared Pools is different from other Smalltalk dialects, as it uses [_declaration methods_](https://www.instantiations.com/docs/92/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm#href=pr/stpr670.html) by means of `_PRAGMA_*` prefixed methods and `%%PRAGMA DECLARE ...` content comment.

This way of declaring Shared Pools has the benefit of being able to declare the shared pool, its keys, and whether the values are constant, how the values are initialized, etc, everything in a single declaration.

In other dialects to declare a Shared Pool you must subclass `SharedPool`, with the pool keys as class variables, and you initialize the values by means of a class side method (by convention `#initialize`).

Since Tonel treats Shared Pools as classes we had to devise a way to provide interoperability with other dialects as well as to support write/load only within VAST.

## Writing Shared Pools to Tonel

When writing a Shared Pool declaration method, the _Tonel Writer_ will convert such method into a `SharedPool` subclass with a class side `#initialize` to initialize its values.

E.g. The declaration method:
```smalltalk
YourApp class>>#_PRAGMA_YourSharedPool

	"%%PRAGMA DECLARE
	(name: YourSharedPool isPool: true)
	(pool: YourSharedPool declarations: (
    (name: YSP_Key1 isConstant: true valueExpression: '1')
    (name: YSP_Key2 isConstant: true valueExpression: '2')
  )
```

Will be converted to a Tonel Class declaration file `YourSharedPool.class.st` with the following contents:
```smalltalk
Class {
	#name : 'YourSharedPool',
	#superclass : 'SharedPool',
	#classVars : [
		'YSP_Key1',
		'YSP_Key1'
  ],
  #type : 'variable',
  #category : 'Your-App'
}  

{
	#category : 'Initializing'
}
YourSharedPool class >> initialize [
	YSP_Key1 := 1.
	YSP_Key2 := 2.
]
```

## Loading Shared Pools into VAST from Tonel

Continuing with the example above, we started from a single declaration method that did both the declaration and initialization of the shared pool and ended up with a class declaration and its initialization method. Looking at the Tonel file we couldn't tell whether such shared pool class definition was generated by VAST or by Pharo/GemStone.

The _Tonel Loader_ will recognize a class that defines a shared pool (by simply checking whether its superclass is `SharedPool`) and will convert such definition back into a declaration method.

But as you might have guessed the Tonel declaration doesn't know anything about whether values were constant, or if they are initialized as _value expressions_ or any other special [_declaration syntax_](https://www.instantiations.com/docs/92/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm#href=pr/stpr671.html), it also doesn't know whether they were declared and initialized all at once or separately (as in other dialects).

So in order to support this the _Tonel Loader_ will convert the above described example of `YourSharedPool` from Tonel into:

```smalltalk
YourApp class>>#_PRAGMA_YourSharedPool

	"%%PRAGMA DECLARE
	(name: YourSharedPool isPool: true)
	(pool: YourSharedPool declarations: (
    (name: YSP_Key1 pool: YourSharedPool isConstant: false valueExpression: '')
    (name: YSP_Key2 pool: YourSharedPool isConstant: false valueExpression: '')
  )
```

Add a reference the declared pool in the application definition:
```smalltalk
Application subclass: #YourApp
  instanceVariableNames: ''
  classVariableNames: ''
  poolDictionaries: 'YourSharedPool'

```

And then create an initialization method like the following:
```smalltalk
YourApp class>>#_SHAREDPOOL_YourSharedPool_initialize
	YSP_Key1 := 1.
	YSP_Key2 := 2.
```

And invoke it after loading.

The `_SHAREDPOOOL_%PoolName%_initialize` is just a convention used to identify the initialization methods, which when written back to Tonel will be converted again into a simple class definition as described before, but also considering this special selectors to define its initializer.


## Avoiding Shared Pool conversion

If the purpose of exporting to Tonel is just to have a file based version of your code that is only going to be loaded back into VAST or to workaround [some issues with the handling of SharedPools](https://github.com/vasmalltalk/tonel-vast/issues/36) then you can export their declarations directly as what they are: methods.


**NOTE**: By default the `TonelWriter` doesn't convert Shared Pools, so you have to explictly set this option if you want to enable it, this can be done programmaticaly by instructing the `TonelWriter` to perform the conversion as follows.


```smalltalk
TonelWriter new
	applications: (Array with: AbtContainerExamplesApp);
	convertSharedPools; "<<-- this line"
	writeProjectInto: aCfsPath.
```

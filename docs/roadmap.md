# Roadmap / Next steps

There are some outstanding features that are missing in the current codebase.

## ENVY/Manager version migration

Be able to migrate the history of an application (or set of applications) from the ENVY Library to a git repository, with one commit+tag for each Application version, etc.

## Real use testing

This codebase was tested with a good suite of unit testing, the example repositories mentioned before and [VAST Tensorflow](https://github.com/vast-community-hub/tensorflow-vast) library.

VAST users might have other use cases and needs that weren't considered in this codebase. If you have suggestions or issues [please report them](https://github.com/instantiations/tonel-vast/issues/) so we can continue .
